		        As an Architectural-Engineering (A/E) professional, I was not unfamiliar with the concept and importance of Version Control (VC) before embarking on a short journey into the world of git and Github. Some of us in the A/E industry push VC harder and are more passionate about it than others, but we all participate in it in some way, shape, or form in our day-to-day tasks. These tasks of course do not involve programming, but the basic concept of VC ports over quite well to the development and upkeep of files as simple as excel analysis/models and word documents, especially in a highly collaborative industry such as A/E. However, just after a week into this journey, I have had <b>2 overwhelmingly clear realizations:</b>
		      </p>
		      <p>
		        1. Even the most meticulous VC I had experienced did not scratch the surface of what the git/Github workflow offers
		      </p>
		      <p>
		        2. Getting familiar with git and Github will take some effort, but certainly no more than you routinely apply to solve any other new problem at your workplace
		      </p>
		      <p><b>
		          THE BENEFITS OF VERSION CONTROL
		        </b></p>
		        <p>
		          We only need to compare the office cubicles of the 1980's and 1990's to the open floor layouts of the modern typical office to remind ourselves that collaboration is a highly valued, and hard-to-ignore trend in the professional world. Most of us have probably experienced working with many people (and quite often with many teams) on the same task simultaneously towards a common goal. With this style of working comes a need for VC so that the parallel efforts of all these people are not wasted on <b>outdated work, incorrect inputs, or invalid assumptions.</b> VC provides us with a clear way of knowing each of these, along with insights into when changes were made, why they were made, and who made them. This allows us to hit the ground running with our own contributions when we start working, and so that our contributions can be more relevant and focused.
		      </p>
		      <p>
		          The world of VC that I have experienced in the A/E industry involves predetermined file naming conventions using suffices and prefixes, clever folder structures (including the infamous <i>"superseded"</i> folder), constant communication about VC over various mediums, and when all else fails, snapshots of directories allowing a reset of work back to some known point in time (but not necessarily to a known condition of work). Most of us are probably familiar (and often frustrated) with some of these traits, and if we spend time, effort and IT dollars on implementing them, then it is probably a good use of our time to check out some of the most popular VC tools out there; git and Github.

		          HOW DOES GIT HELP YOU KEEP TRACK OF YOUR CHANGES?
		        </b></p>
		        <p>          
		          Some basics about git:
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          1. It is a software package that you can download and install on your computer
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          2. You can access it either through a visual desktop application, or through the command line (programmers prefer the latter)
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          3. It "runs" mostly in the background while you continue to work
		      </p>
		      <p>
		          git helps you keep track of changes to files by monitoring all the changes you make as you work. That may sound overly simplistic, but its true. Instead of making your own "version" of files (such as through a Save_as and/or a version/suffix update to the newly created file) you can continue to work on the files themselves on a parallel git "branch" (I like to think of this as a parallel universe.) Your team mates can do the same, and while you are all working in parallel, there is still only 1 copy of the file(s) sitting in your directory (think of this as the "master branch"). When you or any of your team mates are ready to package and contribute (or "merge") your changes (I like to think of this as coming back to our universe), your branch can be merged with the master branch, and all changes and updates can be reviewed before they are accepted. This is when the files on your directory are actually updated. Adding and committing your changes often ensures that the master branch is as close to being holistically current as possible, and that anyone else starting with their contribution has a pretty good picture of where the team is at.
		      </p>
		      <p>
		          git assists in this process by keeping a log of files and changes to files that are tracked (and untracked for that matter), changes that are ready to be merged, and a historical log of the merges you implemented, and the branches you used. In other words, git replaces all the sticky notes we have stuck to every square-inch of our work-space that only sometimes successfully remind us what we intended to do, what we actually did, why we did it, and when we did it. That may sound too good to be true, but it's not! And if you are as nervous about trying it out as I was just a week ago, just jump in and take the plunge!

		          WHY USE GITHUB TO STORE YOUR WORK?
		        </b></p>
		        <p>
		          Some basics about Github:
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          1. It is a website, and therefore not the same as git
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          2. A clue about Github is in its name - "hub"
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          3. It is a place where you and your team can work through the git workflow if you are not all on the same network (and most certainly not in the same office) 
		      	</p>
		      <p>
		          One of the blogs I read about it last week when I myself was trying to figure out what it was mentioned that "Github is to git, what Dropbox was to a flash-stick." That stuck with me as it took a previous way of working most of us likely experienced at some point (traveling, collaborating, and going to meetings with flash-sticks) and compared it to a way of working that allowed for expanded collaboration (using Dropbox). Well, Github is the on-line "hub" that enables that very expansion of collaboration when you are working with git.      
		      </p>
		      <p>
		          Once you get familiar with using git in your safe space (be that all alone at home, or limited to your immediate network of peers) give Github a try. You will instantly unlock access to a world of potential collaborators that could improve your work product. You will still have control of whether or not to accept any of their changes, but let's be honest, there are some pretty smart people out there, and chances are, you will probably want to!!  
		      </p>
		      <p><b>
		          Finally, to my second realization at the start of this blog, you have already taught yourself harder things, and solved harder problems. So if VC is important to you, check out git and Github!

	Q) What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	A) I used:
		<article></article>
		<section></section>
		<p></p>
		<h1></h1> throug <h6></h6>

	  On other pages I have also started using <aside></aside> <nav></nav> <header></header> and <footer></footer> which I keep returning to as well as they more intuitively communicate their intent than using just a plain <div></div>

	Q) How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

	A) Elements get laid out on a page following the tree structure and from top to bottom. The browser looks for the first (top) and outermost element of the tree, and then looks for any children of that element, till it reaches the bottom of that element before moving on to the next element.

	Q) What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
	A) I learned about snippets which seem very powerful. I had started to save bare-bones html and css templates as text files but I see now that Sublime has a much more powerful way of creating, saving, and inserting those in! And even with a scope check! I can totally foresee myself creating more snippets as I generally like using hot-keys, shortcuts, and any other efficient/automated method in general.-->
