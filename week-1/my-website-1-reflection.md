## Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

## Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.


### Navigating Towards Creating a Repository
To create a repository on Github, find and click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner of the page. This will require that you have an account and are logged in. Once you click on that "+" icon, you will see an option for "New repository". Once you click that, you will be taken to a page to set up that new repository.

### Setting up the Repository
First you will need to give the repository a name. Enter this in the field titled "Repository name"

If you like, you can enter a short description of what the repository is in the "Description" field

You will have to choose if you want te repository to be "Pulic" or "Private" - see the prompts for hints

Finally, you have an option to have the repository created with or without a README file, and any licences that you wish to apply.

### Cloning the Repository
On your local computer, open your command-line shell (gitbash, Powershell, or similar)
Browse to the folder within your local computer where you wish to clone the Github repository using (check out the command line crash course if you need help navigating)

Once there, use the following command to clone the repository:
- git clone [HTTPS]
Note: instead of [HTTPS] you will need to enter the address for your newly created Github repository which you can find on the Github page of your new repository in a field titled "HTTPS"


## Describe what open source means.

Open source means to make available not only the output of a software/program, but also it's input or the details of how it was created. By making a program/piece of software open source, the ability to edit it's input is also made available.

## What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think open source is a tricky concept. On one hand, I see and support it's key value of collaboration and sharing of knowledge, but on the other I wonder if it takes away the incentive for people to put in the effort to build great things. On one hand I fully believe in the sharing economy which has much further reaching scope than just computer programming, while on the other I see instances where private and secure ownership makes sense.

Perhaps there is a way to acheive both? I am not sure, but I am exited to learn more before writing open source off as either utopia, or evil.


## Assess the importance of using licenses.



## What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? ## What did you struggle with?


## Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? 

## If so, please list it.
