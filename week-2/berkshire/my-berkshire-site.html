Whew! That was fun!
1. It was great to translate the codeacademy and previous exercise learnings into something tangible, even if it was a simple website, that was copied! It still felt like a tiny victory, that pointed to something tangible.

2. It was fun researching html elements. When we got stuck, my pair and I split up the research and shared what we found with each other as we went along. We were able to solve all our problems with research, and resorted to a clarification on the slack group with the rest of the rock doves.

3. Even though I am probably just scratching the surface on html best practices, I think we did ok sticking to what we knew. We left out formatting and styling, and even didn't use <h> tags (though in hindsight I am wondering if that was the right decision - guess we will find out next week!)

4. I like that html is structured, and intuitive. 100+ tags is a lot to learn, but its really not that much (1,000+ tags would be crazy for example) No complaints about it yet other than the few exceptions that seem like they could and should be fixed (like why just a handful of tags are self-closing?)

5. For now my tricks are limited to bookmarking all of the tag cheat sheets, html resource guides, mozilla network, etc so they are always just a click away. I also set up my own template ".html" file so I don't have to start from absolute scratch every time.
